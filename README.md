What's the difference between how your website is rendered in Lab 4 vs Lab 6? 

For lab 4, the static website will always display the same content to every visitor, while the lab 6 html website can generate different data based on user interactions. Content can change depending on who accesses it. To summarize, a static site is always going to be the same for everyone with fixed information while a regular html is a site where users can input data to view personalized results.
